             <h3>Meet Kakarot</h3>
             <p>
                Kakarot is primarily an action role-playing game with fighting game elements
                The player can battle opponents and do activities like fishing, 
                collecting Z orbs, eating, driving in a hover car, training, and putting characters in soul emblems. The game's plot follows the progression of the anime series,
                as the player interacts with the surrounding world as the different playable characters. Players can explore the world and complete side quests to progress the story.  The game is broken up into four storylines: the Saiyan Saga, the Frieza Saga,the Cell Saga (where the player acquires their hover car), and the Buu Saga.

        <h3>Meet Vegita</h3>
        <p>
            Vegeta is the prince of an extraterrestrial warrior race known as the Saiyans. 
            He is extremely arrogant, proud and hardworking; he often refers to 
            his heritage and royal status throughout the series,but can also have a destructive temper.
            He believed that he should be regarded as the strongest fighter in 
            the Universe and becomes obsessed with surpassing Goku after losing his first battle with the Z fighters.
            However, after Frieza's death, Vegeta unites with the heroes to thwart greater threats to the universe, most notably Cell, Majin Buu, Beerus, Zamasu, Jiren, Broly, Moro and Granolah.
            Throughout the series, Vegeta's role changes from villain to later as one of the heroes,  while remaining a key rival to Goku.
